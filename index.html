    <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
    <p>I remember as a little girl, my grandmother would make all of our 
    bread, our applesauce, and our pasta sauce. It wasn't until I was 
    a teenager, and a friend was making us some spaghetti, that I realized one could buy ready-made pasta sauce at the store ("Didn't everyone make it from scratch?" I thought to myself)! My grandmother often looked after me at my mother's home, where I lived, so we were super fortunate to reap the rewards of her cooking and baking!</p>
<br>
    <h3>It's personal!</h3>
    <p>Cooking is a very personal topic, meaning that we all have different 
    likes and dislikes, personal preferences (I absolutely LOVE a ton of garlic in most savory dishes, but it wreaks havoc on my mother's stomach, so I need to keep that in mind when cooking for the both of us, or if I will be in close proximity to others who may NOT have ingested a ton of garlic recently!), and also can be specific to how the ingredients work with one's body (I tend to avoid nightshades, as I have a history of arthritis).</p>
<br>
    <h3>Something for everyone...</h3>
    <p>Whether a professional chef, a home cook entertaining for parties, or someone who just likes to try new recipes, you will find many options here on my website!</p>
